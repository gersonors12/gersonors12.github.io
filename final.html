    <h3> My idea is to relate to the coffee driven culture we live in and the influence that social media has to get us to buy into it. In today's world we depend so much on caffeine to get things done, especially in busy cities like San Jose. We use this as an opportunity to express ourselves as well by the mugs we brew our coffee in when pop places like Starbucks or Peet's aren't available or we want to save money. Social media I think has gotten us to see that everyone is doing it and that you have to be unique and "cool" when you do it also. I think we all can express a lot from the mugs we choose to represent who we are.  </h3>
