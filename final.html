    <h3> “Chaos”, Digital Video, 1:17 min.

We all want to be a part of history, and movies allow us to get into a reality that no other medium can do. Special effects, acting, set building, and filming, are essential to the creation of iconic movies like Jurassic Park. I always wanted to visit Isla Sorna and have my own adventure with Dinosaurs, minus the killings, and now, even though I’m much older, I’d still want to allow my creativity, and new found skills in technology to take that desire in ways I didn't know I could. </body>
