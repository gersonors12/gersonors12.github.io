    <h1>Project 3</h1>
    <h2> This is My Project 3 Interactive Video </h2>
    
    <p>A New Reality, a <a href="intvid.html">Fresh Start</a></p>
   
   <h2> My idea for project 3 comes from Digimon, a Japanese anime cartoon that I mention in my early internet memory. In the cartoon, the characters are transported to the Digital World, a place in a different reality which they get to by using the signal of the internet and satellites. There they have adventures with their own Digital Monster as they mature to young adults and battle the evil trying to create its dominion over the Digital World. 
In my project I want to use the concepts learned through P5 to create an interactive website that does not only provide a video, but creates one live through users webcams. This would create a filter to the video as to show the user in a “digital world”. I also want to raise awareness that the things we look up online aren’t hidden to the digital world but we are monitored of what we search for, sometimes not by individuals but by algorithms trying to figure out what ads to show before our YouTube videos or email side bars. I’ll add a search bar where users can look up anything they want, all while their digital abstract reflection monitoring their every move.
