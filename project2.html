    <h3> “Dive Into Nature”, Digital Video, 4:13min

In 2018, we live fast, and if you live in Silicon Valley, you move even faster. This is typical among big cities. I want to remind people to remember that life is beautiful despite tough seasons, you just got to have the will to look for it. It’s there. Displayed around 5pm in concrete buildings, the time when most people are trying to get home through the noise of thousands of cars and people bringing a nice peace and serenity. It brings forth the details most of us don’t notice in the trees, or bushes all around us, all while the noise of the city plays in the background naturally. It would be so stressful to just listen to the background noise, but the beautiful images bring this sort of calmness allowing us to Dive Into Nature.
