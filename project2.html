    <h3> In 2018, we live fast, and if you live in Silicon Valley, you move even faster. This is typical among big cities. Life happens and most times, it takes us to be immersed into our jobs, school, and everyday responsibilities that we miss a whole world of beauty in our everyday walks, commutes, etc. I want to remind people to remember that life is beautiful despite tough seasons, you just got to have the will to look for it. It’s there. My installation would ultimately take place as a form of projection mapping in concrete buildings once its sundown. Right now the sun disappears around 5pm, the time when most people are trying to get home through the noise of thousands of cars and people so I think it would bring a nice peace serenity when people pass by it. The recordings are most appropriate to what I’m trying to do. It brings forth the details most of us don’t notice in the trees, or bushes all around us, all while the noise of the city plays in the background naturally. It would be so stressful to just listen to the background noise, but the beautiful images bring this sort of calmness allowing us to Dive Into Nature </h3>
