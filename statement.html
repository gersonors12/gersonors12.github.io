    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <p> Design has allowed us to stand out; to look different and show that difference bodly. To inspire others to become better, and to push their thinking into something more innovative and richer is what I hope to do with everything I do and say. I believe that time is the most valuable thing we have been given, and just when think we have lots of it, it’s then we realize we’re running out of it, and fast. Making the most out of every opportunity is what my life mission is. To be able to convey that positive message through my art is the reason why I find myself thinking innovatively in everything I create. We can miss lots of beauty in design, especially in design encountered every day, and I hope to rescue all that is usually missed and lost, in the midst of our busy minds.To illustrate the joys of the small things in life, I use the idea of abstraction and simplicity in design by looking closer to an object or idea, and to show the world the overlooked design and beauty that everyday things enclose. A tree branch is only a that to the common eye, until one spends an extra couple of breaths observing one and its texture, variation of colors, shapes, etc. When we choose to focus on the little that’s wrong, we can miss everything that’s right. The same we can do with the world around us; we can try to go by it so fast in order to save time, that we actually miss all that’s worth saving from the world.  </p>
